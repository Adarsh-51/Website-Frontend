As someone with a sheltered life until IIT, without trying RK Hall helped me experience true national integration with folks from all over the country (and world) with different languages and cultures cohabitating peacefully. Various extracurricular activities from self-governance, sports, music to various unique competitions helped foster teamwork that many of us could take to our careers. I made some great friends during my 5 years there (1978 - 1983) with batchmates and other contemporaries. I would not trade my 5 years in RK Hall for anything!",
